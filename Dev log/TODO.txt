Verify Working (TESTING)
===============
-Deserialize() doesn't reproduce joints (Bug in libgdx. Probably wait for next release)
-walkers should avoid walking off a cliff (Current method not working correctly)



High Priority
===================
-WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS GAME!!!
-Weapon switching
-Guns use ammo
-Weapon and ammo pickups
-rename bullet to contact damage
-Gun bursts. Semi auto style / 3 round burst and what hava ya
-No padding between tileset tiles causing gaps and artifacts while rendering.
-AI ledge hanging / climbing. How will the AI work with this
-Is the 'PlayerComponent' really necessary anymore? Anything with a controller can be controlled when set to player via player system
-player spawn point. Only spawns a player on one doesn't exist
-Ragdoll corpses
-explosions (area of effect damage) 
-Helicopter thrust affected by frame rate. 


Low Priority
=============
-Rendering order needs work (See SpriteLayer & SpriteCOmponent)
-Construct physics models from json config files instead of being hardcoded
-Thrusters don't work
-rename to entityBounds to 'noSpawnZone'
-Human models are less rigid (Head on a joint)
-maybe a mech vehicle?
-headshots (causes slo-mo)
-Vehicles can have passengers
-Vehicles become leaders
-Entities will try and enter a leaders vehicle. (eject when leader ejects)
-humanoid model is too small and hard to hit. Sprite doesn't line up on bottom
-need some destructable obstacles (boxes/crates/barrels/trees/houses/etc...)
-Animations
-Does ledge hanging work?
-Debug Render can show a text box over entities showing component info


Done
===================
*Vehicles should face towards direction of movement not where aiming
*Vehicles take on the team of operator
*bullet spread on rifle too wide? 
*bullets too dense?
*Copters too fragile
*Helicopter AI is a little weird
*Vehicles keep moving after you exit them
*remove unused AI systems
*Decide on what types of objects collide (Vehicles & characters)
*Raycast callback seperate class
*Game has no way of knowing who killed who. Bullets can't be traced back to entities
*Friendly fire or no?
*people arms fly downward when they die (vision sensor stops being moved with body)
*Pause (p)
*Sticky projectiles (Arrows)
*differentiate between item drop and corpse (2 seperate config strings);
*Some weapons should have a line of sight/range option instead of firing a projectile (Melee combat)
