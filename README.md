A physics based game made with libgdx that doesn't really have much direction anymore. Think I might refocus my efforts on something with a little better end game and smaller scope. I plan on using a lot of what I've learned here for things in the future. Hopefully it can be of use to others as well :)

###How To Get It
A runnable jar is located in the [/ZombieCopter!](/ZombieCopter!] folder. You should be able clone this repo and import into eclipse and run from there as well. You'll need the eclipse gradle plugin to import them. All  game code is located under [/core/src/com/deftwun/zombiecopter](https://github.com/Deftwun/ZombieCopter/tree/master/core/src/com/deftwun/zombiecopter)

<ul>
<li>Desktop version is the only one that works currently. Haven't tried the android version in a bit but it should work. (controls not really ironed out though) </li>
<li>Lots of planned features aren't yet implemented. Can't change weapons in game for example.</li>
<li>Art is NOT good and there is no sound but you can find all the assets under [/desktop/assets/data](https://github.com/Deftwun/ZombieCopter/tree/master/desktop/assets/data) </li>
</ul>


###Story
Nil. Your a guy with an arrow firing gun that drives helicopters and jeeps while shooting zombies.

###Controls
<ul>
<li>w,a,s,d = move</li>
<li>left mouse = fire weapon</li>
<li>q = slo-mo</li>
<li>e = enter/exit vehicles</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Esc = restart</li>
<li>r = toggle render physics</li>
<li>p = pause</li>
<li>numbers 1-6 = change zoom level</li>
<li>tab = debug console. type entity name in and now you can create that entity using cntrl key </li>
<li>left cntrl = debug spawn entity.</li>
</ul>
