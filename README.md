# ZombieCopter
A physics based game made with libgdx that doesn't really have much direction anymore. Think I might refocus my efforts on something with a little better end game and smaller scope. I plan on using a lot of what I've learned here for things in the future. Hopefully it can be of use to others as well. 

#Disclaimer
Desktop version is the only one that works currently. Haven't tried the android version in a bit but it should work. (controls not really ironed out though) 

Lots of planned features aren't yet implemented. Can't change weapons in game for example.

Art is not good 


#Story
Nil. Your a guy with a gun that shoots arrows for some reason and you have to shoot zombies. You have some soldier/police/debatable friends around who shoot arrows out of their guns too! Also friendly helicopters! And a drivable jeep & helicopter! Also when you kill a a soldier he turns into a zombie immediatley and drops a tomato/apple/massive cherry

#Controls
<ul>
<li>w,a,s,d = move</li>
<li>left mouse = fire weapon</li>
<li>q = slo-mo</li>
<li>e = enter/exit vehicles</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Esc = restart</li>
<li>r = toggle render physics</li>
<li>p = pause</li>
<li>numbers 1-6 = change zoom level</li>
<li>tab = debug console. type entity name in and now you can create that entity using cntrl key </li>
<li>left cntrl = debug spawn entity. Look in /android/assets/data/entities to see the things you can</li>
</ul>

Some entities you can type in the debug console to spawn are jeep,helicopter,friend,friendCopter,enemy,enemyCopter,zombie,or civilian.
