# ZombieCopter
A physics based game made with libgdx that doesn't really have much direction anymore. Think I might refocus my efforts on something with a little better end game and smaller scope. I plan on using a lot of what I've learned here for things in the future. Hopefully it can be of use to others as well. 

###How To Get It
A runnable jar is located in the /bin folder. You should be able clone this repo and import into eclipse. You'll need the eclipse gradle plugin & ADT plugin and be sure to import them as gradle projects. All relevant game code is located under /core/src/com/deftwun/platformer/

<ul>
<li>Desktop version is the only one that works currently. Haven't tried the android version in a bit but it should work. (controls not really ironed out though) </li>
<li>Lots of planned features aren't yet implemented. Can't change weapons in game for example.</li>
<li>Art is NOT good but you can find all the assets under /android/assets/data </li>
</ul>


###Story
Nil. Your a guy with a gun that shoots arrows for some reason and you have to shoot zombies. You have some soldier/police/debatable friends around who shoot arrows out of their guns too! Also friendly helicopters! And a drivable jeep & helicopter! Also when you kill a a soldier he turns into a zombie immediatley and drops a tomato/apple/massive cherry

###Controls
<ul>
<li>w,a,s,d = move</li>
<li>left mouse = fire weapon</li>
<li>q = slo-mo</li>
<li>e = enter/exit vehicles</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Esc = restart</li>
<li>r = toggle render physics</li>
<li>p = pause</li>
<li>numbers 1-6 = change zoom level</li>
<li>tab = debug console. type entity name in and now you can create that entity using cntrl key </li>
<li>left cntrl = debug spawn entity. Look in /android/assets/data/entities to see the things you can</li>
</ul>

#####Note
Some entities you can type in the debug console to spawn are 
<ul>
<li>jeep</li>
<li>helicopter</li>
<li>friend</li>
<li>friendCopter</li>
<li>enemy</li>
<li>enemyCopter</li>
<li>zombie</li>
<li>civilian.</li>
</ul>
