# ZombieCopter
A physics based game made with libgdx that doesn't really have much direction anymore. Think I might refocus my efforts on something with a little better end game and smaller scope. I plan on using a lot of what I've learned here for things in the future. Hopefully it can be of use to others as well. 

#Disclaimer
Desktop version is the only one that works currently. Haven't tried the android version in a bit but it should work. (controls not really ironed out though) 

Lots of planned features aren't yet implemented. Can't change weapons in game for example.

Art is not good 


#Story
Nil. Your a guy with a gun that shoots arrows for some reason and you have to shoot zombies. You have some soldier/police/debatable friends around who shoot arrows out of their guns too! Also friendly helicopters! And a drivable jeep & helicopter! Also when you kill a a soldier he turns into a zombie immediatley and drops a tomato/apple/massive cherry
